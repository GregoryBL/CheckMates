# CheckMates
CheckMates is a collaborative, asynchronous bill-splitting app that is focused on spending less time dealing with the bill at the table and more time enjoying a night with your friends. It is an iOS app written in Swift that uses a Rails webapp for having participants choose their items. It was written over 8 days as a final project for Dev Bootcamp.
